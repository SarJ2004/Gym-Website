This is the first website which I made all on my own! It's a basic Gym website. Will add other pages in the subsequent days.
Watch the website live at:https://bloodsweatmuscles.netlify.app/
It's also live on GitHub Pages, but I dont know why the background image is not loading there, whereas I ported the same repo from GitHub to netlify, and it works perectly fine!
